# Examples

In this repository I develop and maintain minimal working examples for various
programming languages. These examples are library independent meaning that they
test features that are native to each programming language.

## Repository structure

```
  ./              Root of repository
├──   c-cpp/      Examples that are C and C++ agnostic (apply to both)
├──   cpp/        Examples for C++
├──   c/          Examples for C
├──   bash/       Examples for Bash
└──   README.md   This file
```

## Motivation

Frequently, I try to answer my questions by writting small related programs.
It would be deligent for me to maintain these examples so I can come back to
them and revisit a specific idea that an example illustrates.
